This Python script uses the Instaloader library to download all publicly accessible content from a specific Instagram user's profile, such as images, videos, captions, comments, and profile pictures. The user must log in with valid Instagram credentials. The example targets the profile "kingjames". The downloaded content is saved in a subfolder, and may include .jpg, .txt, and .json files depending on the post metadata.
