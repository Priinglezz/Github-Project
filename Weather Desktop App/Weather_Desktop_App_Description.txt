This Python script creates a desktop GUI weather application using tkinter. Users can type a city name and press Enter to fetch the current weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app displays the main weather condition, temperature (in Â°F), min/max temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset times. The UI includes a central entry box and dynamically updates weather info below it.
