[digital clock.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20197260/digital.clock.txt)This Python script creates a digital clock using the tkinter GUI toolkit. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds (with AM/PM) using the system's time, refreshed every second. The interface is styled with a large digital-style font ('ds-digital') and uses a purple background with white text. The clock is centered in the window, and the application requires no external libraries beyond tkinter and time.
