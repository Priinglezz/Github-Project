This Python script creates a GUI application using the tkinter library to calculate a person's age. The user inputs their name and date of birth (year, month, and day) into entry fields. Upon clicking the "Submit" button, the app calculates the age based on the current date and displays it in the window. The application is titled "Age Calculator" and includes basic layout enhancements like padding for better UI presentation.
