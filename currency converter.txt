This Python script creates a GUI-based currency converter using the tkinter library. It allows users to select two currencies, input an amount, and convert it using real-time exchange rates from the RapidAPI currency converter API. The interface includes dropdowns for currency selection, an entry box for the amount, and a button to trigger the conversion. The result is displayed with the appropriate currency symbol. The app also includes custom styling and an icon image for visual appeal.
