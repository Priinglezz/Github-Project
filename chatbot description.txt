This Python script builds a chatbot application with a GUI using tkinter. It connects to a Google Sheet that contains a list of questions and answers (FAQ format). When a user types a question, the bot uses fuzzy matching (via the fuzzywuzzy library) to find the closest match in the FAQ. If a match is found with high confidence, the corresponding answer is displayed in the chat interface. The interface includes a scrollable chat window, an input box, and a send button. It requires credentials for accessing the Google Sheet (via keys.json).
